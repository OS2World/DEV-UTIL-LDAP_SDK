How to use:
icc -C -Gm -I\ldapsdl\h yourprog.c
icc yourprog.obj libldap.lib liblber.lib libldif.lib tcp32dll.lib so32dll.lib
icc yourprog.obj ldapdll.lib
icc yourprog.obj ldapdll41.lib

Note:
OS/2 Warp 4 and later OS/2s have TCP/IP 4.0 runtime.
OS/2 Warp Server for e-business and later OS/2s have TCP/IP 4.1 runtime.
If you want for your LDAP programs to work on any OS/2s, I recommend you to use
ldapdll.lib or libldap.lib/liblber.lib/libldif.lib.
The programs linked with ldapdll.lib must work with ldapdll.dll.
The programs linked with ldapdll41.lib must work with ldapdll41.dll.
